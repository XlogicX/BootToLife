# BootToLife
Game of Life as implemented in a 512 MBR image<br><br>

This simulation dutifuly applies the main 4 rules of the game of life in the 80x25 pixel space of TextMode of a boot image. The only sloppy part that isn't completely perfect is the horizontal axis wraping (the far left/right edges affect the life of a cell on the other side).<br><br>
